 README.md Entry for GitHub:
📅 Day 9 - Portfolio Project UI Optimization + Card Functionality
What I did today:

🔧 Made Projects and Achievements cards fully functional on the homepage

🎨 Improved overall UI and UX for a more polished experience

🧠 Refactored the codebase to ensure reusability and modularity

🧹 Reduced unnecessary lines of code and improved readability

📱 Ensured responsive layout for short, medium, and large screens

📁 Cleaned and organized folder structure for maintainability and scale

These refinements elevate the user experience while keeping the codebase production-friendly and scalable.

Thanks to Hitesh Choudhary for the constant guidance and motivation.
