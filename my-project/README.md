📅 Day 8 — Context API & Dark Mode Integration
✅ What I Did
Today’s focus was on optimizing theme control in my React portfolio project using the Context API. I built a global dark/light mode toggle system from scratch and styled it seamlessly with Tailwind CSS.

🧠 Concepts Learned
I learned how to use React’s Context API for global state management. I created a custom hook (useTheme) for clean and reusable logic. I also worked with Tailwind CSS’s darkMode: 'class' configuration to toggle themes effectively. This helped me better understand component structure, reusability, and the importance of scalable code design. Theme-aware UI was implemented using Tailwind's dark: variants.

🔨 What I Built
I built a complete Theme Context to manage dark/light mode across the app. I created a responsive Theme Toggle Button with a clean switch UI and added it inside a new Dropdown Menu component in the header. I updated the layout to support both themes consistently and ensured smooth transitions with mobile responsiveness in mind.

💡 Takeaway
This was my first hands-on experience using Context API in a real project. It helped me avoid prop drilling and made my app’s structure much cleaner. Tailwind CSS made theme styling fast, efficient, and consistent across components.

🙏 Special Thanks
Huge thanks to Hitesh Choudhary for his amazing guidance. His teaching style and practical approach made it easy to break down and implement complex concepts like context and theming.
