# ⚛️ Functional React Portfolio (Rebuilt)

This is the **functional upgrade** of my original Tailwind CSS portfolio — now powered by **React** and **React Router DOM**!

---

### 🔄 What's New:
- Transformed from static UI to dynamic React app
- Implemented routing with `<Routes>` and `<Route>`
- Set up dynamic layout with `Outlet`
- Used `loader` for route-level data fetching
- Functional navigation and structured routing

---

### 📄 Pages Included:
- Home Page
- About Me
- Contact Me

Each page now works via **React Router**, unlike the static Tailwind version before.

### 🛠 Tech Stack:
- React
- React Router DOM
- Tailwind CSS
